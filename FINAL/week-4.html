<h1>Week 4</h1>
<h3>Choose your Adventure - Who Inspires You?</h3>
<p>In Week 4 I uploaded my app to the repository where I made a Choose Your Adventure game. I also wrote a short paper about who inspires me and that my number one source of inspiration was my mom. She is such a kind and warmhearted woman who is absolutely selfless when it comes to taking care of everyone.</p>

<p>The Adventure Game App I created was not very extensive, but I felt that it was a good example of what is possible with coding. It did its objective and that is the main of goal with coding.
