<h1>Week 10</h1>
<h3>p5.js Moving Componants</h3>

<p>In week 10 we took our self portrait from week 9 and added shapes that moved at different speeds and in different directions. This was difficult, but after another office hours meeting everything made sense. It wasn't that I wasn't doing it correctly, it was that I wasn't doing enough and not realizing it.</p>

<p>The multiple photos show how the different shapes move around my self portrait.
