<h1>Week 11</h1>
<h3>p5.js Game</h3>

<p>We created a game in p5.js in week 11. The goal of the game was to have a user controlled object to make it across the canvas into a finish area. In between the user and finish are obstacles that made the process more difficult. This was a week where the previous week really helped and made the moving of objects easier.</p>

I really enjoyed working with colors and these are some of my favorites. I like when colors play against themselves and they are similar but they are also clearly different.
