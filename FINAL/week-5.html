<h1>Week 5</h1>
<h3>Alice.org</h3>
<p>In Week 5 we moved into working with Alice.org and this was definitely my least favorite assignment during the semester. I could not wrap my head around the mechanics of Alice and found it very difficult to use. I was able to make the characters move and talk, but getting the camera to move just never really worked like I wanted it to.</p>
