<h1>Week 1</h1>
Week 1 we introduced ourselves. I was definitely nervous for this class. I had never done anything like this before and it is always scary stepping outside of your comfort zone and trying to do something new. Coding is hard, I knew that before class started and I am more sure of that as I am working on my final portfolio. I am very grateful that there are people out there that are passionate about coding and do the hard work for the rest of us.
