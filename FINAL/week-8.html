<h1>Week 8</h1>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>


<p>The math game was something that took a lot of time trying to get it to work. I spent hours trying to get the code to run properly and eventually made some progress to the point it worked. JavaScript also took some getting used to and I was very happy when a pop up actually showed up.</p>

<p>Just seeing the pop up say "Hi there!" was proof that I was doing something right and inspiration to keep working.</p>
