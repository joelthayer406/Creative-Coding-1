<h1>Week 2</h1>
<h3>Artist Lab Tutuorial</h3>
<p>In Week 2 we focused around the Dance Party Hour of Code and Artist Lab Tutorial. I found these both unbelievably helpful. They helped show the basics of coding in a very approachable way. I was very excited that we did this to open the class before jumping into Atom.</p>

<p>This is the certicate for finishing the Artist Lab Tutorial and the shape I created at the end of the tutorial at the very end. I enjoyed playing around with this.
