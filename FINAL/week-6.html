<h1>Week 6</h1>
<h3>HTML</h3>

<p>Week 6 is really when we started coding. We had to make an about, interest and contact page in a coding app. I chose Atom because it had good reviews and people said it was user friendly. I included my Kobe Bryant artwork included in this week.</p>

<p>It doesn't look like a lot but making this list probably took me two hours to finish. It was a cool feeling seeing that I finally had coded something on my own.
