<h1>Week 9</h1>
<h3>p5.Js Self Portrait</h3>
<p>Week 9 was my favorite assignment and introduced us into p5.js which was a fun program to use. We drew self portraits of ourselves and I liked how it would update itself to help show you instant results.</p>

<center><img src="week9.png" width=900 height=400></center>

<p>I was extremely proud of how my self portrait came out. I feel like I did a very nice job with not only the coloring but also the shapes of the portrait. This is something that I was comfortable with right away.</p>
