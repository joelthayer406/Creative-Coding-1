<h1>Week 3</h1>
<h3>Scratch</h3>
<p>In week 3 the program Scratch was was also very helpful and another solid jump into coding. After doing projects like this I was definitely more comfortable to work with actual coding than before. This stuff is helpful and I think that doing programs like these are necessary in ground level classes like this. They don't just give you information but also help make people comfortable with what is in the future.</p>
