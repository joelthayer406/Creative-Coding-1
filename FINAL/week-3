In week 3 Scratch was a program that also very helpful and another good jump into coding. After doing projects like this I was definitely more comfortable to jump into actual coding than before. This stuff is helpful and I think that doing things like these are necessary in ground level classes like this. They don't just give you information but also help make people comfortable with what is coming.
