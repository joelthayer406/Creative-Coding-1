<h1>Week 13</h1>
<h3>p5.js Polished Game</h3>

<p>Week 13 is very similar to week 12. I had more trouble with week 13 however and I am not positive why. I could not figure out what I was doing and my grade justifiably reflected the mistakes I made in this week.</p>

<p>As you can see, it is very similar to week 12. I just couldn't wrap my head around this one. I also wasn't able to come into office hours due to car trouble so it was just a tough week.
