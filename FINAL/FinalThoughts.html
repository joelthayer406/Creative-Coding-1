<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
<h3>Joel Thayer</h3>

<p>I enjoyed this class because it pushed me and helped me fully realize how tough coding can be. A lot of Media Arts courses have taken me out of my comfort zone but I would say this is at the top of the list. Sometimes when you are outside of your comfort zone you can create your best work. Creative Coding might have been too outside of my comfort zone for me to create something great but I am happy with the work I made in this class. Also just as a side note for Michael, I appreciated your ability to make coding seem approachable for people who have never thought about coding before. I also appreciated your open door and willingness to reply to emails and help out students. There are a lot of professors out there who check theirs students emails bi-weekly so you getting back quickly was definitely appreciated.

Thanks,

      Joel</p>
